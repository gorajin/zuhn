## Introduction (0:00–2:58)
Anthropic makes great products. Clot
code is fantastic. Co-work is fantastic.
But they are grains of silicon doing
matrix multiplication. They don't have
consciousness. They don't have an inner
monologue. You take an LLM and train it
on pre 1916 or 1911 physics and see if

it can come up with the theory of
relativity. If it does, then we have
AGI.
>> Just today, by the way, Daario allegedly
said that you can't rule out that
they're conscious. You can rule out
their cost. I think I mean come on to
get to what is called AGI. I think there
are two things that need to happen. One
is

>> Michelle. It's great to have you in
again.
>> Great to be back. This is one of my
favorite topics which is um how do LLM
actually work?
>> And I think that uh you in my opinion
you've done kind of the best work on
this modeling it out.
>> Thank you. For those that did not see
the original um one, maybe it's probably

worth doing just a quick background on
kind of what led you to this point and
then we'll just go into the current work
that you've been doing.
>> 5 years ago when GPD3 was first

released,
>> uh I got early access to it and I

started playing with it and I was trying
to solve a problem related to quering a
cricket database.
>> Yeah. And I got GPD3

to do in context learning, few short
learning. And you know it was kind of
the
first at least to to me it was the first
known uh implementation of rag retrieval

augmented generation which I used to
solve this problem of uh querying
getting GPD3 to translate natural
language into something that could be
used to query a database that GPD3 had
no idea about. I had no access to GPD3's
internals, but I was still able to use
it to solve that problem. So, it it it
worked beautifully. Uh we we deployed uh
this uh in production at ESPN in

September 21. But
>> Wow. Wow. You
you did the first implementation of Frag
in 2021.
>> No, no, no. In 2020.
>> 2020.
>> 2020. I got it working and by the time
you talked to all the lawyers at ESPN
and you know, productionize it, it took
it took a while. But October 2020 we had

well I had this architecture working but

after I got it to work I was amazed that
it worked. I wanted to understand how it
worked
>> and I looked at
you know the attention is all your deep
papers and all the other sort of deep
learning architecture papers and I
couldn't understand why it worked.
>> Yeah.
>> So then I started getting sort of deep

into building a mathematical model.
>> Yeah. And now you published a series of
papers. The first one that I read was
the one where you had kind of your
matrix kind of abstraction. So maybe
we'll talk about that and then we'll
talk about the more recent
>> Yeah.
>> work.
>> So perhaps we'll just start with the
first one which is
## LLM as Giant Matrix (2:58–8:24)
>> you were trying to you were trying to
describe you're trying to come up with a
mathematical model of how LLM works.
>> Yeah.
>> And you had which was very helpful to me
which was um and at the time you were
actually trying to like figure out how
incontext learning was working.
>> Yes. Yeah.
>> And you came up with an abstraction for
LLMs which is basically this very very
large matrix and you use that to
describe. So maybe you can kind of walk
through that work very quick.
>> Sure.
>> Yeah. So so what you do is you you

imagine this huge gigantic matrix where

every row of the matrix corresponds to a
prompt.
And the way these LLMs work is given a

prompt they construct a distribution of

probabilities of the next token. Next
token is next word. So every LLM has a
vocabulary, you know, GPD and its
variants have a vocabulary of about
50,000 tokens.
>> So given a prompt, it'll come up with a
distribution of what the next token
should be. And then all these models
sample from that distribution.
>> Yeah. So that's the posterior
distribution.
>> That's the posterior distribution,
right? That that's how LLM work. And so
the idea of this matrix is matrix is for
every possible combination of tokens
which is a prompt, there's a row.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> And the columns are a distribution over
the vocabulary.
>> So if you have like a vocabulary of
50,000 possible tokens, it's a
distribution over
>> those 50,000 tokens.
>> And by distribution, it's just the
probability
>> just the probability. Sorry. Yeah. Just
the probability that the next token
should be this versus that.
>> Y.
>> Uh so that that's sort of the idea and
and when you start viewing it that way,
it makes things at least clearer to

people like me who want to model it. uh

what what's happening? So concretely
let's say you have an example that

uh let's say your prompt is just one
word protein. Yeah. So if you look at

the distribution of the next word next
token after that uh most of the uh

probabilities would be zero but you'd
have non zero non-trivial probabilities
on let's say two words one is synthesis

the other is shake
>> right and now the LLM is going to sample

synthesis sample uh this next token and

man pick synthesis or shake
>> or you as a human will give the prompt

protein shake
>> or protein synthesis. Now, depending on
whether you pick synthesis or shake, the
next that row looks very different,
right? If you pick protein synthesis,

the terms that would have a high
probability would be all concerned with
biology, right? But if you pick protein

shake, it'll all be about gyms and
exercise and all, you know, bodybuilding
stuff. So, that synthesis or shake
completely changes what comes next.
>> Yeah. So this is an example of uh you

can say bijian updating.

You start with protein you have a prior
that after protein this is going to
happen. As soon as you get new evidence
then the next term is synthesis or shake

you completely update the distribution.

So now you can imagine that the whole
the the entirety of LLM is this giant
matrix where you have every row protein
protein shake protein synthesis the cat
sat on the
>> you know Humpty Dumpty blah blah blah

>> now given uh the vocabulary of uh these

LLM let's say 50,000 and the context

window so GPD for instance chat GPD the

first version had a context window of
8,000 tokens. Yeah, if you look at all

possible combinations of 8,000 tokens
and 50,000 uh vocabulary, the number of

rows
in this matrix is more than the number
of electrons across all galaxies. Right?

>> So, so there's no way that these LLMs
can represent it exactly now.
Fortunately, this matrix is very sparse.
Why? Because you know an arbitrary
combination of these tokens is
gibberish. We're not never going to use
that in natural in real life.
>> Yeah.
>> Also, the columns are also mainly zero.

>> Yeah.
>> Right. If you have protein, then you
won't have lots of, you know, you won't
have arbitrary numbers or arbitrary
words after that. It's very sparse both
in rows and in columns. So I in kind of

an abstract way what all these LLMs are

doing is coming coming up with a
compressed representation
of this matrix and when you give a

prompt they try to approximate what the

true distribution should have been and
try to generate it that that's what uh
in my mind at least it boils up to
>> just from my understanding. So if you
have a row of uh protein

and then you have one with protein shake

>> Mhm.
>> is protein shake a subset of protein or
is it different?
>> It's different. It's a continuation from
>> I see.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. No, but I'm just saying like the
actual the actual posterior distribution
is that a subset?
>> You you can say it's a subset, right? Uh
if you have protein then protein shake
and protein synthesis are all
continuations from protein. So both
synthesis and shake have non-zero
probabilities. So you can yeah

you can think of it as somewhat a subset
## What Is In-Context Learning (8:24–13:00)
>> right
>> you you know you use this approach to
describe how in context learning works
and so maybe first describe what in
context learning is and then kind of the
conclusion that you came from that. So
eight context learning is when you

uh show the LLM something it has kind of

never seen before. You give it a few
examples of this is what it wants uh
this is what you're trying to do. Then
you give a new problem which is related
to the examples that you have shown
>> and the LLM learns in real time what
it's supposed to do and solves that
problem. And by the way, the first time
I saw this, it absolutely blew my mind.
And I actually I actually use your DSL

>> when I was like first learning about it.
So maybe like kind of like

the DSL thing is just just crazy this
works at all.
>> It's absolutely, you know, mind-blowing
that it works. And so going back to that
cricket problem was you know
in the mid '90s uh I was part of a group
that had created this uh cricket portal
called cricket info.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh cricket uh is a very start sport. You

know you think baseball multiply by a
thousand. at all kinds of stats and we

had created this uh
online searchable database called stats
guru where you could search for anything
any stat related to cricket and has been
available since 2000
>> but because you can query for anything
everything was be made available and how
do you make something like that
available to the general public well
they're not going to write SQL queries
>> the next best thing at that time was to
create a web form unfortunately ally

everything was crammed into that web
form. So as a result you had like 20
drop downs, 15 checkboxes, 18 different
text fields. It looked like a very
complicated, daunting interface. So as a

result, even though it could solve or it
could answer any query, almost no one
used it. A vanishingly small percentage
of cricket fans use it because it it
just looked intimidating. And then ESPN

bought that site uh in 2007.
I still know people who uh run the site

and I always told them you know why
don't you do something about stats guru
and in January 2020 uh the
editor-inchief of cricket info Sambbal
he's he's a friend so he came to New
York and we had gone out for rings and
again I told him you know why don't you
do something about stats guru so he
looks at me and says why don't you do
something about stats guru he was joking
but uh that idea kind of stayed with me
and when GP3 was released I thought
maybe I could use stats guru
use GP3 to create a front end for stats

guru.
>> And so what I did was uh I designed a
DSL a domain specific language which uh

converted queries about cricket stats in
natural language into this DSL.
>> No.
>> And to be clear you created this it
wasn't like part of like any training
that was online that like could have
seen.
>> Nothing GPD could have seen. I created
it. I thought okay this makes sense. So
I designed that DSL and then I did that

few short learning things. So I would so
I created about a database of about I
would say 1500 natural language queries

and the DSL corresponding to that query.

So when a new query came in, somebody's
asking a stats question in English. What

I would do is I would go through the
natural language queries, do a semantic
search, pick the most closely matching

top few.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh and then use that natural language
query and its DSL and send that as a
prefix. Now GPD3, if you recall, had a

context window of only 2,000 tokens.
>> Yeah. So you had to be very judicious
about which examples that you picked.
But you pick that and then you send the
new query and GP3 would complete it in
the DSL that I had designed which until
milliseconds ago it had never seen.
>> Yeah.
>> And I had no access to internals of
GPD3. I had no access to the weights.
>> Yeah.
>> But still it worked. So that that's how
so
>> so so it's not obvious to me given your
matrix example of like a prompt and then

a distribution how something like in
context learning
>> works
>> would work and so like I think your
first paper
>> tackled this problem
>> right
>> um and so maybe you could walk through

your understanding of how LLMs

do in context learning.
## Bayesian Updating as Evidence (13:00–19:13)
>> Yeah. So, so when you think about what
in context learning is is that

as you see evidence. So, so you know in
the first paper what I also did was I I
took this cricket DSL example.
>> Yeah.
>> And I uh

I depicted the next token probabilities

>> mhm
>> of the model as it was shown more and
more examples. So the first time you
show it this DSL the natural language
and the DSL the probabilities of the DSL

tokens were were extremely low because

GP3 had never seen this thing. When it

saw the cricket question

in its mind it was trying to continue it
with an English answer.

So the probabilities that were high were

all English words.
>> Yeah. Once it saw my prompt where I had

the question and the DSL, the next time
I had the question in the next row, the
probabilities of the DSL token started
going up
with every example, it went up and
finally when I gave the new query, it
was like it had almost 100% probability
of getting the right token.
>> Yeah.
>> So this is an example of in real time

the model was updating its posterior
probability. It was upgrading its
knowledge that okay I've seen evidence
this is what I'm supposed to do. Now
this is a colloquial way of saying what
Beijian
>> inference is. Beijian updating basically
is you start with a prior when you see a
new evidence you update your posterior.
That's the mathematical division. But
but in in English it's basically you see
something you see new evidence you
update your belief about what's
happening.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So it was clear to me that LLMs

are doing something which resembles
Beijian updating. So in that first paper
I had this matrix formulation and I
showed that you know what it's doing. It
looks like Beijian updating.
>> Yeah.
>> Then we can come to the sort of next
series of papers.
>> That's right. So okay so I mean it it it
seemed pretty conclusive to me at that
time and then you went quiet for a while
and then I still remember the WhatsApp
text. You said Martin I know exactly how
these things are working now.
>> Yeah. Well
>> and then and then and then listen you
dropped a series of papers that kind of
broke the internet. like you went super
viral on Twitter like I mean people
really noticed. Um uh and so I I want to

get to that in just a second. But before
that, um
>> I remember when your first paper came
out, people would be like,
>> you know, these things are definitely
not Beijian. Like, you know, you know,

anything could be considered to be
Beijian, but they're not. Like, why do
you think that there was this reaction
to like,
>> you know, there's something new, they're
not Beijian? I mean, I felt like there's
almost kind of a backlash just because
they're being characterized as
>> Yeah. Yeah. I I think this whole world
of uh uh probability and machine

learning that there have been camps of
Beijian and frequentists.
>> Yes.
>> And I don't want to get in the middle of
that sort of political battle, but
Beijian has become like almost like
people had a reaction to that. It's it's
part of that war.
>> I see.
>> So, it's like the old Beijian
frequentist type battle. Yeah. So, so
people just had oh no you can say
anything is Beijian right? So I said
okay maybe they have a point maybe what
we are saying is not really Beijian how
do we prove that it's Beijian
>> right
>> so then first I have to thank you and

and Harovitz for this uh

>> you know when I when I when I said that
I in my first paper I showed these
probabilities
>> uh it was because open AI had in its

chat uh interface
uh this option to displays those
probabilities then they stopped

>> so we could not peer inside what's going
what's happening for some reason they
stopped openai
I'm not going to get into
>> the open and close but but they stopped
so then we developed our own interface
which could let you look not only at uh

the probabilities but also the entropy
of the next token was this on top of an
open source model
>> yeah yeah so so you can load any sort of
open source model but you know being an
academia
We didn't have access to compute. Thanks
to
>> your generous uh uh donation, we got uh

the clusters
>> to run uh over what it's called token
probe. So you can go to
tokenprobe.cchs.colia.edu.
>> Is it still running?
>> It's still running. It's still running
and people come to it. Uh I use it in my
classes uh to get students to do
assignments. They write their own DSLs
and you know they say that that it
really helps them understand how these
LLMs work. So I literally my
understanding of LMS came from token pro
just you know sit there and just look at
the the distribution as as you filled
out a prompt. It's actually very very
enlightening. So for those of you that
are listening um
>> what's the URL again?
>> Token probe
>> token probe.cs.colia.edu.

>> Yeah check it out. It's actually very
very useful way to I can actually see
how the probability distribution gets
updated as as you fill out a prompt.
>> Right. Yeah.
>> But then I cheated.
Oh,
>> I you know it was running
>> but I also had access to the GPUs that
were powering it.
>> Mhm.
>> And then along with colleagues at
Colombia and one of them now is uh is at

deep mind we started to sort of think

about how do you really prove that it's
Beijing
to prove
>> Can you just explain it? Actually I I
actually don't know the answer to this.
>> Yeah. It seemed to me you proved it in
the first paper like what was missing.
>> Well, in the first paper we showed it.
It was empirical
>> and you could see I see I see you could
see not a mathematical because it was
obvious to me that
>> yeah it was even obvious to me but to
convince uh you you could say you know

people who dismiss oh anything can be
based in
>> I see I see
>> we had to show it precisely
mathematically.
>> Got it. Got it. So then we came up with
## Bayesian Wind Tunnel Tests (19:13–27:22)
this idea you know my colleagues at
Namanagaral and Sedhad Dalal we the
series of papers were were written with
them. We came up with this idea of a
Beijian wind tunnel. Okay so what's a

wind tunnel? Well wind tunnel in the
aerospace industry is where you test an
aircraft in an isolated environment. you

don't fly it and you test test it
against all sorts of uh uh you know
aerodynamic pressure then you see what
what it'll withstand what kind of
altitude pressure blah blah blah right
you don't want to do it up in the air
testing
>> so we said okay why don't we create an
environment where we take these
architectures and we tested transformers
mamba LSTMs MLPS all architectures we

say why don't we create take a blank
architecture.
Give it a task where it's impossible for

the architecture to memorize what the

solution to that task should be.

The space is combinatorily
impossible for given the number of
parameters and we took very small
models.
So it's difficult enough that they
cannot memorize it
>> but it's tractable enough that we know
precisely what the the Beijian posterior

should be. You can calculate it
analytically.
So we gave these models a bunch of tasks
where again we show that it's impossible
to memorize. We trained these models and
we found that the transformer got the
precise Beijian posterior down to 10 ^

minus 3 bits accuracy. It was matching

the distribution perfectly. So it is
actually doing Beijian in the
mathematical sense given a task
>> where it has to update its belief. Uh
Mamba also does it reasonably well.
LSTMs can do one of the things. So the

in the papers we have a taxonomy of
Beijing task. Transformer does
everything. Mamba does most of it. LSTMs

do only partially and MLPs fail
completely.
>> So is this a reflection of the data that

it's trained on or is it more a
reflection of the mechanism?
>> It's the mechanism. It's the
architecture.
The data decides what tasks it learns.

>> Right? So in the first paper we had
these beijian wind tunnels and we show
that you know it's doing the job where

different tasks in the second paper we
show why it does it. So we look at the
transformers we look at the gradients
and we show how the gradients actually
shape this geometry
which enables this basin updating to

happen.
Then in the third paper what we did we
take we took these frontier production
LLMs which have open weights so that we
could look inside them and we did our
testing and we saw that the geometries
that we saw in the small models

persisted in models which are you know
hundreds of millions of parameters the
same signature existed. The only thing
is that uh because they are trained on
all sorts of data, it's a little bit
dirty or messy.
>> Yeah.
>> But you can see the same structure. So
the the whole idea behind the Beijian
wind tunnel was unlike these production
LLMs where you don't know what they have
been trained on,
>> right?
>> So you cannot mathematically compute the
posterior.
>> So again, how do you prove it?
>> I mean it looks based in you know from
the first paper.
>> From the first it looks Beijian, but you
know. So the wind tunnel sort of solved
that problem for us. We said okay let's
start with a blank architecture. Give it
a task where we know what the answer is.

It cannot memorize it. Let's see what it
does. And
>> so do you think this provides any sort
of like indication of how humans think
or do you think that these things are
totally independent?
>> No no it it does provide right. So you

know human beings also
uh update our beliefs as we see new
evidence. Right. So we do in some sort

of in some sense uh Beijian updating but

we do something more than that I'll come
to that but uh these transformers uh or

even mamba do this beijian updating

>> and uh but but but the difference with

humans is
you know we we'll update our posterior
when we see some new evidence but the
way our brains have evolved evolved over

hundreds of millions of years is our
optimization objective has been don't
die and reproduce. Right? That's been

sort of the driving force and our brains
have learned to adjust and so when we
see some danger
there's some something rustling in that
bush. Don't go near. We know how to

react to that danger. We know how to uh
save ourselves.
We internalize that
learning and our brain cells or our
synapses remain plastic throughout our
lifetime. What happens with LLM is once

the training is done those weights are
frozen.
when you're doing an inference for
instance in context learning or anything
during that conversation
okay you're doing bijian inference but
then you forget
the next time a new conversation starts
with zero context you don't retain any
learning that happened in the previous

instance so so for instance with the
cricket DSL that I was doing every
invocation of it was fresh

it did not remember the last time I sent
a query what the DSL looked
So that's one difference between uh

how humans uh uh use sort of beijan

updating which is we remain plastic all
our lives
>> whereas uh LMS are frozen and there's

another uh sort of

difference which uh if you want me to
get
>> tell me yeah yeah yeah
>> so so the other difference is uh u

well first you know our objective ive is
don't die reproduce. LLM's objective is

predict the next token as accurately as
possible. Right? So all these uh

scary stories that you you read about

that oh the LLM tried to deceive and it
tried to prevent itself from being shut
down. That's not a function of the
architecture.
That's a function of the training data.
>> It has been fed you know articles on
Reddit or SMO or whatever. I mean, just

today, by the way, Daario

>> allegedly said that uh you can't rule

out that they're conscious.
>> You can rule out their I mean, come on.

And I said, you know, Antropic makes
great products. Cloud code is fantastic.

Coco work is fantastic,
but they are grains of silicon doing
matrix multiplication.
They don't have consciousness. They
don't have an inner monologue. They
don't uh they're not driven by the same
objective function. Don't die,
reproduce, right? They're driven by
don't make a mistake on the next token.
And that's driven entirely by the
training data,
right? You train the LLM with stories of
ASMO or Reddit where you know to survive

it's going to do this or that. It'll
reproduce that. So it's it it's a
reflection. It's not a mind. And and the
results, just to say it for the 10th
time, are perfectly vision.
>> Perfectly. Yeah.
>> To the to the to the digit.
>> To the digit. Yeah. I mean, I I trained
it for 150,000 steps
>> and uh the accuracy was 10 ^ minus 3

bits.
>> I could have trained it for you know
this happened in half an hour
>> on the infrastructure that you provided
for token pro in the background. I could
use those APUs to train. But uh so thank
you again for that. But so no human
beings coming back to it, we we are
## Brains Simulate Causality (27:22–36:34)
>> Beijian,
>> but we do something else. You know when
I when I when I throw this pen at you,
what will you do?
>> Dodge it or
>> do it? Yeah.
>> Why will you dodge it?
>> To avoid being hit.
>> Avoid being hit. But your head is not
doing a Beijian calculation of okay,

this pen is coming. The probability that
it hits me, it'll cause this much pain
or all that.
>> Correct. What you're essentially doing
in your head is you're doing a
simulation.
>> You see the uh the the the pen coming

and you know that it'll come and hit me.
Your mind simulates and you dodge it.
Right? So
all of deep learning is uh doing

correlations.

It's not doing causation.
>> Yeah. Causal models are the ones that
are able to do simulations and
interventions. So you know Judea has
this whole uh causal hierarchy
>> where the first hierarchy and the first
hierarchy is association which is you
build these correlation models. Deep
learning is beautiful. It it's extremely
powerful. I mean you see every day all
these models are like amazingly good.

>> They do association. The second is
intervention
in the hierarchy. Yeah,
>> deep learning models do not do that.
Third is counterfactual.
So both intervention and counterfactual
you can imagine it it it's some sort of
simulation.
You you build a model of causal model of
what's happening and then you are able
to simulate. So our brains do that.

The current architectures don't do that.
Another example I think which will make
it clear is uh the difference between

I'll use these technical term Shannon
entropy
>> and kmogrove complexity.
>> Sure.
>> So if you look at the Shannon entropy of

the digits of pi
>> it's infinite.
>> Sure.
>> It's impossible to predict and learn
what digit will come after. Yeah. So
that's the definition of Shannon entropy
and Shannon entropy sort of tries to
build a correlation. It tries to learn
the correlation. Deep learning does the
Shannon entropy.
>> Gulmagraph complexity on the other hand
is the is the length of the shortest

program.
>> Yeah.
>> Which will reproduce
uh the string that you that is under
question.
>> Yeah.
>> Now the program to get the digits of pi
are very small.
>> Yeah. Thanks to Raman Jim and others you
know there all sorts of really small
program that can reproduce it exactly.
So the colograph complexity of pi is

very small. Shannon entropy is infinite.
>> I think deep learning is still in the

Shannon entropy world. It has not
crossed over to the colog complexity and
the causal world.
>> Wow interesting.
>> Right. So uh do you to what extent do

you think this provides us research

directions to kind of improve the state
of the so let me just give you a
specific example you talked about
>> human beings don't actually update you

know the matrix they don't kind of
update their weights
>> but right now there's a lot of research
on continual learning you know so

>> does your work provide some guidance of
how you might approach those problems
and and in particular I've always had
this question which is we use so much
data and so much compute.
>> Yeah.
>> To create these models like is it even

reasonable to think that you can update
the weights and actually have a
meaningful impact you know with in in

real time. I mean it just seems like you
just need so much more data in order to
do that. So can you start answering
these questions?
>> You you can start answering some of
these questions and and one of the
misconceptions that exists today is that
scale will solve everything. Scale will
not solve everything. you you you need a
different kind of architecture and this
continual learning is a difficult
problem. You have to balance the fact
that you will learn something new
against the risk of catastrophic
forgetting.
>> Right.
>> Right.
>> Right.
>> If you update the weights and you forget
what what was important and what you
have already learned then then you are

you know you're not making progress.
Then it'll just be some sort of random
chaotic model. So to solve that problem
is difficult. That's one aspect of it.
So, so, so you know to get to what is
called AGI, I think there are two things
that need to happen. One is this
plasticity
which has to be implemented through
container learning.
>> Secondly, we have to move from
correlation to causation.
>> Yeah,
>> that's uh uh I how much is this similar

to what Yan Lun talks about with the
>> so Yan Lun causality planning?
>> Yeah. you know predicting like how your
action would
>> it is it is related you know he he's
coming at it from a different angle than
the jp model right
>> but it is related the the other thing is
uh you know the first time I came on
this podcast I I mentioned this test of
AGI
>> the Einstein test
>> I don't remember
>> so I said you know uh uh you take an LLM

>> and train it on pre 1916 or 1911 physics

>> and see if it can come up with the

theory of relativity.
>> Yeah,
>> if it does then we have AGI. I mean it's
a high bar but you know we should have
high bars. It won't. And this is the

same test that I think Demis uh

mentioned at uh the India AI summit
couple of weeks ago. It's created a lot
of news. But why why is that and how is

that related to this idea of Shannon
versus Kro?
So at the time of Einstein there were a

lot of clues
that Newtonian mechanics there was
something missing.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. Uh people knew that Mercury's
orbit didn't make sense. There was
something off about it. Then there were
these experiments done uh the
Michaelelsson Mley experiments where

they were trying to figure out uh

uh this uh medium called uh the ether

through which light travels.
And they felt that if you know you
bounce light in different directions

uh the speed might change and they they
could detect a change in the speed of
light.
They tried several experiments. They had
really precise instruments which could
measure the speed and they found
nothing. They found that that speed of
light did not change at all.
Then there were there's a whole issue of
black holes.
>> Yeah.
>> Then gravitational lensing. So there
were a lot of these signs that Newtonian
mechanics
is not really explaining everything.
>> Yeah.
But until Einstein came up with a new
representation of the space-time
container,
>> right,
>> we were stuck.
>> So if you had a model that just looked
at correlations and so uh sees all of
this, you know,

all of these uh pieces of individual
evidence and put together, it would not

have come up with the beautiful equation
that Einstein came up with. you know uh

I'm forgetting exactly what it is g muv=

8 pi t muv some something like that

>> where you know uh the the the equation
of uh the rel the space-time continum
that the tensor
>> so he came up with a new formulation

>> so he kind of rejected the existing

axioms he came up with a very short

colograph representation of
>> interesting
>> the world
>> one equation from that equation
everything else follows
>> right whether you're talking about
gravitational waves or black holes or
mercury or how GPS works you know GPS

the GPS that we use every day in our
phones it uses the equation of
relativity so do does this end up

becoming like
um
you you you almost have to ignore the
majority of previous data in order to do
it which LLM can't because they're
trained on the majority of previous
data. It's like you almost have like
this kind of data gravity that's pulling
you back. It's like it's like everybody
said it's X.
>> There's a little bit of evidence that
it's Y, but because everybody said it's
X, like the LM will always say it's X.
>> It'll always say it'll treat that Y as
an anomaly. Actually this is actually a
very nice way to say it which is like
>> it's like
>> I so now okay now I get your Shannon
entropy versus like one of them is like

>> the total amount of information there
that will always be bound to the total
amount of information there which is
what happens right now.
>> Yeah. where you can actually describe

another another motion. You can describe

everything with a shorter description

with the new data, which would be a
totally different motion, which would be
like
>> you need a new representation, right?
## Manifolds and New Representations (36:34–42:17)
Yeah. You know, another way that I've
always thought about these, I thought
you articulated it well in the last time
we talked about it, which is the
universe is this very, very complex
space and then, you know, somehow humans

map it into a manifold.
>> Mhm.
>> That's less complex.
>> Yeah.
>> And then that gets kind of written down
and then the LLM. So that's kind of some
some distribution, some you know, it's
still a very large space, but it's it's
a bounded space. And the LM learn that
manifold and then they kind of use,

you know, Beijian inference to move up
and down that manifold, but they're kind
of bound to that manifold.
>> Yeah.
>> And then again, I don't want to put
words in your mouth. And then, but like
what they can't do is is generate a new
manifold, right? Which requires
understanding the way that the universe
works and then coming up with a new
representation of the universe.
>> And this is what relativity is, right?
>> Yeah. Exactly.
>> Einstein had to create a new manifold.
>> Yeah. If you just stuck with the old
manifold of the Newtonian physics,
>> then you would see these correlations
but you could not come up with a
manifold that explained them. So you
need to come up with a new
representation. So to me you know there
are lots of definitions of AGI uh you
know Turing test we have already passed
that you know performing economically
useful work every day you see you know

LLMs are doing that.
>> Do we I don't know. No, I mean they are
>> I mean I mean without human
intervention.
>> No no no. So that that's different but
still you know it's like a car can run

faster than humans, right?
>> I mean that's a that's the that's a
that's a very shallow definition.
>> Yeah. So all these definitions do useful
>> you know maybe you know in 6 months
you'll have cloud or what a gemini do

without intervention cing tasks which
are well defined well scoped
>> that's possible but to me AGI will

happen when these two problems get
solved
>> elasticity continual learning properly

and building a causal model from you
know
uh in a more data efficient manner Yeah,

we we are hearing people now talking
about you know seeing generality like
Donald Kuth for example in the last few
days right you know had this you know

this you know aha moment apparently that

kind of made went viral on X so do you
think that that suggests that we're
seeing generality or
>> No no no so so that actually

to me it validates what I've been
talking about for a while now how
>> so so if if you read what he did uh with

the help of uh you know a colleague he
got the LLMs to solve this particular
problem of finding Hamiltonian cycles

odd numbers we won't get into that and
he got the LLMs to keep solving for one
odd number after the other right
>> what he also got to do is after it found

a solution for a particular value of m

he made the LLM update its memory

with exactly what it learned in solving
that problem. So the LLM's tried many
different things. Yeah.
>> You know, something worked, update the
the memory. So that's kind of like
hacking together plasticity.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. It's learning what it has done as
we went along. Again, it's it's a hacked
version of it. You're not changing the
weights. You're just sort of improving
the context.
>> Right.
>> Right. But you as you learned and even
after that so this whole space of

Hamiltonian cycles and the associated
math is well represented in the

manifolds that these LLMs have been
trained on
>> right you just had to find the right
connection and LLMs I know compute you
throw enough compute they will find the
right connection so can was able to find

the LLM's
attempts And eventually it needed him

to put together what he saw into a
solution. It definitely helped him get

to the solution but he had to create the
new sort of manifold
>> to come to the solution. The LLMs were
after a while stuck right he you read
what he has written. I mean it just hot
up the press I think two days ago.
>> Two days ago days ago but uh eventually
he used the solutions and he came up
with uh the proof.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So it's like you know it's like

Einstein saw all these evidences

then he thought what will explain

he came up with a causal model.
>> Yeah. So canut and his brain is sort of

the
>> that's in the chimograph is the human

right and the llms are extremely
efficient at doing the shannon part of
it. It found all the solutions by trying
you know various things and learning
more and more
>> clever way to decompose it. I'm
wondering like do you think this again
I'm going to ask the same question again
which is do you think this provides some
sort of insight on like the next problem
to tackle like yeah
>> like like is there a mechanism that will
get the kagarov complexity

>> or not like is this it tells us which

direction
>> but clearly not how to do it like
>> not how to do but even colograph
complexity has largely remained a sort
of a theoretical construct
>> yeah for sure there's no algorithm
There's no there haven't been practical
implementations of finding
>> the shortest program.
>> We know it exists. You know, you can
argue about it. It but so so that's
where I think
>> it's my bias. That's where our energy
>> should be focused not larger models with
more tokens.
## Simulation as Short Program (42:17–46:48)
>> Can you and can you can you tie the two
things like how does that pair with
doing simulation or is that simulation
totally orthogonal?
>> No, simulation is is related, right? So
you think it like basically you do
simulation and somehow that is a step

towards doing the kagra complexity.
>> It it's it's the simulator is the is the

program that we create. It may not be
the perfect program.
>> Oh I see.
>> But in our heads we create this uh
simulator that when I'm throwing the pen
you know that it's coming at you right
and you duck. So, so you're not
computing the probabilities as it goes,

but but you have, you know, you build a
very physical thing versus we were
talking more conceptually.
>> Conceptually, but but it's the same
because of the same mechanism.
>> It's the same mechanism really.
>> Yeah. You have to build a causal model.
>> Yeah.
>> Right.
>> I see. For most things, right?
>> So, you have to move from correlation to
causation. I mean, we've heard this
term.
>> Yeah. you know
add infinitum but here it it's making a

difference in the way we view
intelligence
>> how how how has the last three papers
been received
>> no I don't know there well I mean I mean

the archive
>> versions will let me tell you it I mean

>> um lot of great reception a lot of
people read it I'm just wondering like
what kind of feedback that you've got
>> I'm getting good feedback but I'm an
outsider in this field right that's
right like networking guy.
>> I'm a networking guy. Why is he writing
about you know learning and machine
learning and deep learning and basian so
but but people who have actually taken
the time to read those papers I'm
getting really good feedback uh there

was a recent paper by Google
research
>> which tried to teach uh LLM by some sort

of RLF to do Beijian learning properly.
>> Yeah.
>> And that's going in this direction. And
I think people are coming around to the
view that okay LLMs are doing Beijian
learning. I know that some people also
looked at the Beijian vent tunnel paper
the archive version and they reproduced
the experiments.
>> That's great.
>> Did they just saw what was written and
they they did the trading and they saw
yeah this is actually happening. So
>> that's great. So what's next?

uh what's next is uh you know these two

parallel uh tracks I hope to make

progress there plasticity and causal

>> because today you've taken an existing
mechanism
>> and you've created a formal model how it
works
>> and so now you're actually interested in
improving in creating a new mechanism
>> and do you think it's an entirely
different architecture
>> I or do you think do you think LLMs are
like part of the solution
>> I think LLMs are definitely part of the
solution.
>> I see.
>> But but there has to be something more
>> and other.
>> So you know I was not interested in sort
of cataloging what all these
>> LLMs can do.
>> Was more interested in why are they and
how are they doing it.
>> I think now we have a good grip on

>> the why and how.
>> And the next step is to you know
>> move them to the next level. We we now I
I think we have a fairly good
understanding of what the limits are.
>> Yeah.
Now how do you uh go to the next step?

>> Is there an is there an equivalent kind
of theoretical
framework for causality that applies
here like similar to like Beijian for
inference?
>> Well the Japal's whole causal hierarchy
I think
>> I think that's the right one.
>> That's that's a very good one. You know
the whole do calculus uh approach

I think it's a good way to think about
it. you know the the sort of association

intervention counterfactuals.
>> Yeah.
>> It takes you from correlation to
actually simulation.
>> Yeah.
>> In a mathematical way.
>> That's great.
>> All right. Well, listen, really
appreciate you coming. This is awesome.
So, we had you here for the first paper
where you had the empirical results.
>> Mhm. And then we had you back when you
actually have like the formal proof and
hopefully the next time you come back
you will have a proposal for the
mechanism that uh
>> that actually provides the next step.
>> Hopefully.
>> All right. Cool. Thank you for coming
in.
>> Thank you for having me.
